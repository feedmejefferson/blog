## Chef Jefferson

I'm Chef Jefferson -- the head chef here at Feed Me, Jefferson!

When I met Karen, I took over the responsibility of feeding her; we even went so far as to put it in my wedding vow -- "... to love and cherish, to feed and nourish..."

It's usually an easy job -- as long as I have cheese and refried beans on hand. Sometimes though, Karen gets a craving and she just doesn't know what she's hungry for. I generally ask a bunch of questions -- do you want something hot, or cold? Sweet or savory? I always thought it would be easier if there was an app that would help her figure out what she was hungry for though, so that she could just show me.

And that's where our story began...

## Our Mission

Our mission is very simple -- to keep Karen fed and happy!

If it turns out that others can benefit from our mission, so be it.
