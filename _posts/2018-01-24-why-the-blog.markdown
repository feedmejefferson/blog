You, like Karen, may be wondering, what's the point to a blog? Why do all
these hipster website feel the need to have their own blog? Well, to be 
honest, I think it's partly just developer narcissism _(ooh, look at me, I'm
cool, I have a website...)_, but there really is a little more to it that 
just that. 

For one thing, when you're doing something (or a lot of things) for the first 
time, you tend to make a lot of mistakes and learn along the way. When you're
jumping between all those firsts, it's easy to forget what you learned a week
ago if you haven't been taking notes. A blog is a nice way of sharing the new
things you've learned with other people -- including your future self. 

Secondly, a blog can help with self promotion (which in fairness kind of 
relates back to the narcissistic tendencies I mentioned...) When you share
the things that you've learned, other people that are trying to figure out
how to do the exact same thing will ask google how to do it and may come 
across your answer. It's a good way to get recognized as an authority in 
the field -- which can help if you're ever on the market for a shiny new job.

It's not only about self promotion though. All those blog posts have a lot of
content that shows up in random searches, and all those blog posts point back
to your websites home page -- which not only promotes you the blogger, but
also the website or application that you're working on. They help push your 
website up higher in the list of google and other search engines search results.

So why are we, here at [Feed me, Jefferson!](http://feedmejefferson.com), 
bothering with a blog? We aren't really anywhere near the point that we
want the general public to start hitting our site, but eventually it might
not hurt. For now it's mostly a matter of getting into the habit of telling 
the world (mostly our friends) what we're up to and on the technical side
keeping notes for ourselves so we don't forget how we did something.
